## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structures implemented in Java. Designed for educational purposes, it covers a variety of data structures including Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more. Each implementation is accompanied by detailed comments and usage examples to facilitate understanding and learning.

## Features
- **Diverse Implementations:** Covers common and advanced data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, Heaps, Graphs, and more.
- **Detailed Documentation:** Each data structure includes thorough comments and explanations to aid comprehension.
- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests are provided to ensure the correctness and reliability of each implementation.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed to be easily integrated into your Java projects for practical use.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java 11
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Testing Framework:** JUnit 5
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mehregan-Gogina/Data-Structures-Project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Data-Structures-Project
    ```

3. **Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).**

4. **Build the project using Maven:**
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

## Usage
- **Importing a Data Structure:**
    ```java
    import com.example.datastructures.LinkedList;
    ```

- **Example Usage:**
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
            list.add("Item 1");
            list.add("Item 2");
            list.add("Item 3");

            list.display(); // Displays all items in the list
        }
    }
    ```

- **Running the Application:**
    Ensure you have a `main` method as shown above and run it through your IDE or via the command line:
    ```sh
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
    ```

## Running Tests
To ensure all implementations work as expected, run the unit tests using Maven:
```sh
mvn test
```
This command will execute all tests and display the results in the console.
